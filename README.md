# Deploying a Fine-Tuned YOLO Model for Bone Fracture Detection on Vipas.AI

## Overview
Object detection models are widely used in AI to identify and classify objects within images. Among them, **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection model known for its speed and accuracy. **YOLOv8**, the latest version, offers improved performance and efficiency across various detection tasks.

By fine-tuning YOLO on **X-ray images of bone fractures**, this model can **accurately detect fractures**, assisting radiologists with quicker and more reliable diagnoses. This AI-powered solution is **fast, scalable, and deployable** on **Vipas.AI**, allowing AI creators to share their innovations with the world.
